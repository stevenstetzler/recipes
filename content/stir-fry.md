## Ingredients

**Tofu and Vegetables**
- 4 tbsp or 1/4 cup oil
- 1 lb extra firm tofu
- 1 lb fresh or frozen vegetables[^vegetables]
- 1/2 cornstarch
- salt
- pepper
- ground ginger

**Sauce**
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/8 cup rice vinegar
- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 1.5 tbsp cornstarch[^cornstarch]
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 2 cloves garlic
- (optional) 1 tbsp sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Press the tofu to remove excess water. Remove the tofu from its packaging, wrap in a clean towel, place on a cutting board, and place a heavy flat object on top of it. I usually use a cast iron pan or a pot with water in it. Take care that the heavy object doesn't fall off as the tofu is pressed! (The tofu will shrink/deform over time, slanting the originally flat top.) Leave it pressing for 10 minutes or more. A longer press (or pressing at all) will change the texture of your tofu to make it more firm and also prevent it from crumbling later on.
2. Once pressed, use a knife and the cutting board to cut the tofu into pieces of the desired size. I usually go with 1/2 inch cubes, but feel free to try larger, smaller, or different shapes.
3. Season the cornstarch with salt, pepper, and ground ginger. I've never overseasoned the cornstarch, so give each a few good shakes. Next, coat the tofu in the cornstarch. I usually place the 1/2 cup of cornstarch in a large tupperware, season it, place the chopped tofu in the tupperware, place the lid on it, and give it a few gentle shakes to coat the cornstarch evenly. I usually eyeball the amount of cornstarch, so feel free to add more if not all the tofu is coated.
4. Heat the oil in a large pan at medium-high heat, and wait until it is hot. The oil will have a shimmery look to it but should not be smoking (that's too hot). Place the tofu either all at once or in batches (if using a smaller pan) into the hot oil. Cook the tofu for a few minutes on each side, allowing them to become golden brown. Remove the tofu from the oil and set aside. You can use a paper towel to absorb excess oil from the tofu. Continue until all tofu are cooked.
5. While the tofu is frying, create the sauce. Press the garlic to peel it, remove the stem, and mince or press with a garlic press. Add the cornstarch and water to a bowl. Adding this first and mixing prevents the cornstarch from clumping. Add the remaining ingredients and the garlic to the bowl and mix.
6. Fry the vegetables in the same pan at medium heat, using the leftover oil. If there is too much oil left over, remove it by either pouring it out or soaking it up with paper towels. Cook until vegetables reach desired tenderness, perhaps 5 minutes or so when using frozen vegetables. A lid helps to steam the vegetables as well and cook faster before they brown. Remove the vegetables from the pan once cooked.
7. Turn the heat down to low. Give the sauce a final mix and then pour into the pan. If the pan is hot, it will rapidly boil and thicken. If this happens, stir quickly to form a thick sauce. If the pan is not that hot, it will simmer and thicken slowly, in which case you should continously stir until the sauce thickens. People say this part smells really good. (The vinegar I believe.)
8. Once the sauce is thickened, add the fried tofu and vegetables back to the pan and stir to coat them in the sauce. Serve with rice.

## Notes

[^vegetables]: I usually use 1 lb frozen "stir fry" blend. Sometimes I only use frozen broccoli.
[^cornstarch]: The cornstarch controls how thick the resulting sauce is. The amount in this recipe makes a thick sauce. If you want it thinner, add more liquid (which will make more sauce overall) or add less cornstarch.
